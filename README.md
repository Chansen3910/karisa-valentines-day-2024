# Heartstring Heroine: Charismatic Capers

A web-based game written by Collin Hansen for Karisa.

## Enter the city of Carthage

As the smoke clears and the last remnant of civilization emerges from an age of darkness, a sinister presence lingers in the air... Just kidding, the city is not even named Carthage lol.

## Enter the city of `Cardia`

Though the people of the lovely city of `Cardia` may seem nice, they trust no one.. If you cause any blockages or arrhythmia to their daily routine, they will not hesitate to arrest and bypass you!! This may seem vein and cold-hearted to some, but to the people of Cardia, the beat of their drum is entirely involuntarily, and WARRANTED.

After all, the crown is rumored to bear the secrets of the "Heart of Gold", a canonical utterance known to many only by the many permutations of ancient Aortic myths and tall tales. Most people find the stories heart to even believe, but still, nefarious treasure hunters do not skip a beat in their attempts to lay siege and steal the precious heart of the people of Cardia.

Lately, among other abnormal and mysterious happenstances, the "heart attacks" have become more frequent, and are believed to be supplied by a distal foe.. Can you get to the heart of the matter and defibrillate this coronary conundrum???
